# Javascript and classes

## OOPs

## object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use OOP
OOP provides modularity, reusability, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism, making code easier to manage, extend, and debug. It simplifies complex problems by modeling them with real-world objects.

## part of OOP
Object literal
- constructor function 
- prototypes 
- classes
- Instances (New, this)

## 4 Pillars
- **Abstraction**:
        Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
- **Encapsulation**: 
        Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class.
- **Inheritance**:
        Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child class) inherits the properties and methods of another class (parent class).
- **Polymorphism**:
        Polymorphism means "many forms" and it occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
